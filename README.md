# Hi, I'm Josh

### Fun Fact

Before tech, I toured internationally for nearly a decade as bandleader and musician with Cirque du Soleil's TOTEM. I played over 2600 shows in 45 cities around the world. That experience taught me leadership, discipline, adaptability, and how to collaborate under pressure — qualities I now bring to software development.
