<div>
<p>Before tech, I toured internationally for nearly a decade as bandleader and musician with Cirque du Soleil's TOTEM. I played over 2600 shows in 45 cities around the world.</p>
<p>Being a musician has taught me discipline, adaptability, leadership, how to work as a team, group dynamics, creative thinking, how to perform under pressure, and the power of focus and flow states. These traits and abilities feed back into my work as a developer. I thrive in collaborative, cross-functional teams and believe strongly that people do their best work when they're having fun.</p>
